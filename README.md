# GDP-Browser
A browser that can let you browse github DYNAMIC pages

## Sever.txt
A list of servers in this format:
```
gitcode.net
github.com
server3
...
```

## Format
The browser can get the content of any normal websites. However, if one wants to access the GDPN (Github Dynamic Page Network), they need to enter the url in the following format:
organization_name:repository_name.gdpn/

I strongly suggest that anyone uses the default settings:
only use gitcode.net for server,
and only use the organization gdps for the url. (e.g. gdps:hibachu.gdpn/)

## Warning
People who use github.com and other servers need to be responsible for any damage due to maliciouse malware from the repository.
